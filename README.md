While still a developing field, interactive statistical graphics have been a topic of interest since the late 1960s. Recent development of the R and JavaScript frameworks Shiny and D3 has made it much more accesible for statisticians and practitioners to have interactivity in their graphics, specifically for the web. While much of the work in interactive statistical graphics has focused on the general interactivity tasks of linking plots, brushing, labeling, and scaling, other work seeks to solve more specific data problems through the use of interactive statistical web graphics. In this talk I present three examples of the latter goal, as well as a brief overview of the steps needed to build a basic application that makes use of both Shiny and D3.
